# Agenda++

Welcome to this flashback, it's about one of my first memories with programming, as well as a very special moment since achieving this challenge marked a before and after for me in the steep learning curve of the first languages I began to learn for programming. 

This application is a dynamic agenda capable of performing a complete CRUD in addition to having a search by name, alias, or city.

Without further ado, enjoy the strong typing! Old school rules!
